# AGENT TASK PLAN

1. Confirm requirements
   - Capture key directions from REC draft and HOME trial example.
   - Note simplicity, plain-English tone, map requirement, placeholder pre-screen link, neutral palette.
2. Draft content outline
   - Identify minimal sections (hero, who can join, what study involves, how to take part, FAQ snippet, contact info, map, partners/logos).
   - Ensure language aligns with approved text.
3. Prepare assets and data
   - Gather provided logos/illustrations placed under an `/assets` folder.
   - Compile site list with coordinates/addresses for map display.
4. Build static page
   - Create single HTML file with inline CSS/JS.
   - Implement responsive layout, map (e.g., using Leaflet with inline data), and placeholder button.
   - Highlight clarity and readability per spec.
5. Review & test
   - Open page locally to check layout in browser (file:// friendly).
   - Validate text accuracy vs. draft and ensure map markers/link target present.
